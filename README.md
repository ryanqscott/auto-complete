# Simple autocomplete component

A simple autocomplete component created as part of a take home assignment

Bootstrapped using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The autocorrect component is pulling data from the [dogapi](https://dogapi.dog/docs/api-v2).
Roughly an afternoon was spent on this, I didn't time myself strictly but I started and finished on the same afternoon, and had a nice lunch and a shower in that same afternoon.
